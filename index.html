                Hello, thanks for viewing my first landing page. This was a great achievement for me and it has been fun to make as well. 
                Here is a little about me! My name is Brandon Seda. I was born and raised in NYC, but I dont really like bacon egg and cheese on rolls. 
                This may be due to lack of confidence but either way I am going through The Odin Project in the hopes of pushing myself to being reaching the goal of working in a tech company.
                I really appreciate any feedback or advice given to me throughout this journey and I hope to meet new like-minded people along the way!
